Interdepartmental conflicts in Indian governance present formidable obstacles to efficient policy implementation and administrative effectiveness. This paper provides a critical examination of the underlying causes of these conflicts, which include entrenched hierarchical structures, competitive resource allocation, communication deficiencies, and overlapping policy jurisdictions. The analysis underscores how these conflicts contribute to delayed implementation of policies, inefficient resource utilization, diminished governmental accountability, and erosion of public trust in governmental institutions.

Drawing on legal frameworks and constitutional provisions, the paper explores the role of the Supreme Court in adjudicating disputes arising from interdepartmental conflicts, thereby shaping administrative practices and upholding constitutional principles of governance. Additionally, it highlights loopholes within current governance structures that exacerbate these conflicts, such as ambiguous policy mandates and inadequate coordination mechanisms.

The research identifies key challenges in addressing interdepartmental conflicts, emphasizing the need for structural reforms to streamline bureaucratic processes, enhance interdepartmental coordination, and clarify policy responsibilities. It advocates for integrated governance models that promote collaborative decision-making, capacity-building initiatives to improve conflict resolution skills among government officials, and the establishment of robust accountability mechanisms to ensure departments are held responsible for their actions.

This study also provides a comparative analysis of interdepartmental conflicts in global governance contexts, specifically examining challenges faced by the USA, UK, and Canada.
Furthermore, the paper proposes practical strategies to mitigate interdepartmental conflicts, including leveraging technological solutions for better information sharing, harmonizing conflicting policies through legislative reforms, and fostering a culture of transparency and openness in governmental operations. By addressing these challenges comprehensively, Indian governance can enhance its efficiency, effectiveness, and ultimately rebuild public trust in governmental institutions.
